        Is the idea of New York City as a sanctuary city still true for refugees? I wanted to ask
        people if they thought this was still true today by creating a guessing game for people to
        complete a line graph. Information and data provided by the US State Department's Refugee
        Processing Center which is revealed by AR. This project was conducted at the Parsons School
        Of Design as part of a Data Visualization exhibition.
