<ProjectInfo title={frontmatter.title}>
    <Text>Formula is a party series in Washington D.C organized by electronic artists, James Bangura and Nativesun. The goal of Formula was to introduce new sounds and cultural experiences to DC. Formula aims to spotlight unique and often unheard music in the city, making it the central focus. The vision is to create a hub—a third space—where creatives and like-minded individuals could come together and connect.</Text>
