    <Text>Path to Jobs is a workforce development, career readiness, and job placement organization that prepares low-income New Yorkers from historically underserved communities to become frontline workers in positions such as Health Coach, Peer Navigator, Community Health Worker, and Harm Reduction Specialist.
Path to Jobs was incubated by Alliance for Positive Change, a leading multiservice organization that provides low-income New Yorkers living with HIV/AIDS and other chronic conditions with access to quality health care, housing, harm reduction, coaching, and peer training. In 2022, Alliance launched Path to Jobs to scale its 30 years of career-readiness and job-placement leadership by expanding the model into a statewide workforce development innovator for the health and human service sectors.
