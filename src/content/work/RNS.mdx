 <Text>
    Founded in 1934, Religion News Service (RNS) is a nonprofit news organization that provides coverage of religion, spirituality, and faith-based issues. It reports on a wide range of religious topics, including Christian, Muslim, Jewish, Hindu, and other faith traditions, along with secular issues affecting religion in society. RNS offers news, analysis, and commentary to a diverse audience, including journalists, scholars, and the general public. Its mission is to deliver accurate, balanced, and insightful reporting on religion in a global and multicultural context. I worked with Commercial Type to redesign RNSâ€™s identity and website for the 90th anniversary of the organization.
