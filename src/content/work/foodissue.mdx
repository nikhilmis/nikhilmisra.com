        The Food Issue, a one-off publication designed to show off Commercial Type's extensive range
        of text faces. Type specimens have traditionally functioned as ephemeral objects meant to be
        looked at rather than read; with this project, Commercial Type wanted to try something a
        little different. Working with editor Caren Litherland, we commissioned six different types
        of articles from writers whose work they admire (as well as the proprietors of a Malaysian
        snack shop around the corner from their office), ranging from short fiction to local news to
        a “listicle,” all loosely threaded together around the theme of eating.

    The website was designed to feature a language switch from English to Mandarin. Mandarin is the
    national language of Singapore and we wanted to appeal to the local population as well.
