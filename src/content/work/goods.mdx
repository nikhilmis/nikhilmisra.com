<Heading text="Research" />
<Text> What started as two separate ideas—reselling clothing and building something with real social impact—quickly turned into a challenge 
I couldn’t ignore: could I bring these two worlds together? To find out, I dove into conversations with seasoned online sellers and 
wandered through New York City's resale shops and fashion events, gathering stories, insights, and inspiration from every corner.</Text>

<Heading text="Prototyping" />
<Text> After completing my research, I began iterating through multiple rounds of wireframing and prototyping. The product evolved continuously, with changes made at every stage based on new insights and feedback.</Text>

<Text>The standout feature of Goods is the option to donate a portion of your purchase to one of our partner organizations. At checkout, users can browse through our current partners, learn about their missions, and choose exactly where their donation goes—making every purchase a chance to give back.</Text>
