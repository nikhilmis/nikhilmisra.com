    <Text>Goods is a non-profit marketplace where people can buy and sell clothing items. With every purchase, Goods donates 10% of the proceeds to a selected non-profit partner. By partnering with different organizations every 2-3 months, Goods ensures a diverse and far-reaching social impact.
Shop sustainably, support a cause, and make a differenceâ€”all in one place.</Text>

<Heading text="Research" />
<Text>The project started out with two ideas of reselling clothing and creating a service for social impact.
    I wanted to see if I could merge these two worlds together. I started my research by talking to various
    people who have sold clothing on the internet. I also did field observations by going to various
    reselling clothing stores and fashion events in New York City.</Text>
