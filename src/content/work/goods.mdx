        Goods. is new way to fund non-profit organizations. Goods is. a non-profit marketplace where
        people can buy and sell clothing items. With each item you buy, Goods. takes 10% percent of
        the purchase and donate it to a non-profit partner. Goods. partners with different
        organizations every 2-3 months to maximize social impact.

    Research
    <br />
    <br />
    The project started out with two ideas of reselling clothing and creating a service for social impact.
    I wanted to see if I could merge these two worlds together. I started my research by talking to various
    people who have sold clothing on the internet. I also did field observations by going to various
    reselling clothing stores and fashion events in New York City.
